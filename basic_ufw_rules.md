# Basic UFW Rules
Make sure you put these in order from TOP to BOTTOM as the order does matter. Doing otherwise could allow some connections to make it past our system, and if you want to check the order of rules, you can do 
`sudo ufw status numbered`.
If anything ever happens where you want to reset all the rules (and disable the firewall), use the command `sudo ufw reset`, just remember the firewall will be OFF after doing so.

If there are services that you don't need (DNS is not required on many devices), just completely skip the code block for the service.

Allows VNC (IMPORTANT FOR PROXMOX)
```
sudo ufw allow vnc
```
Allows SSH
```
sudo ufw allow from <IP WHERE WE SSH FROM> to any port 22 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow out to <IP WHERE WE SSH FROM> port 22/tcp
```

Allows HTTP requests
```
sudo ufw allow from <WEB IP> to any port 80 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow out to <WEB IP> port 80/tcp
```
Allows DNS requests
```
sudo ufw allow from <DNS IP> to any port 53 proto udp
sudo ufw allow out to <DNS IP> port 53/udp
```
Safety defaults to minimize unnecessary outgoing/incoming traffic.
```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default deny outgoing
```
These can help us find if there are errors in how the firewall is setup or if connections are being interfered.
```
sudo ufw logging on
sudo ufw logging medium
```
Once you do all of the above (Don't forget SSH rules!) then enable.
```
sudo ufw enable
```
